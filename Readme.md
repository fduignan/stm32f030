Code for the development of an unofficial Dublin Maker badge for 2019
The goal is to produce a badge design costing less than 5 Euro.  The
badge will consist of a display, buttons, buzzer and an STM32F030 MCU.
The badge will also permit inter-badge gaming using a wired interface
(under development :)
Dublin Maker is happening on July 20th 2019 (in Dublin of course)
